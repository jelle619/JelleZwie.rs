## Appearance
![Bluefire](https://i.imgur.com/X7fIwFc.gif)

A western dragon with a scaly charcoal-black skin and glowing deep blue eyes. Horns among the back slightly following its curvature until the tail, where they become more rounded and point upwards. The horns on his head point straight backwards. He has a tiny horn on his nose. Due to the sharp contrast between the horns/teeth/claws and his skin, they appear very white. The inside of his wings is grey, with his plated belly being the same colour. He wears decorative bandages around his arms/legs.

## Abilities
### Blue fire
The ability to breathe a special kind of fire so hot it can easily melt rock. Bluefire's skin offers natural resistance to this kind of fire as to not burn himself. He inhabited this ability from his ancestors. Even though the bloodline carries it, only when none with this ability are alive will the next newborn get to posses this ability.

### Corruption
Bluefire's corrupted form is his most well-guarded secret. It is a form in which he temporarily lets the darkness within him take control over his body. It's triggered by severe emotional stress (e.g. anxiety, fury, rage) or someone attempting to corrupt him using corruption magic.

His claws, teeth, and horns elongate, sharpen and whiten. His eyes glow more than usual and his pupils become invisible. His scales and belly plates become pointier, more sawblade-like. Some of his veins may become visible as they radiate blue.

He is stronger and ever so slightly taller in this form. His senses become more sensitive and his blue fire ability is greatly enhanced, being able to breathe nearly limitless quantities of it and the smoke coming from the flames being slightly poisonous. A longing for destruction and blood, which he may go as far to consume, fueling him. He can barely keep friend and foe apart. Any bit of his calmness or tenderness disappears, being replaced with utter terror until there's nothing left. It's incredibly difficult to calm him down in this form, let alone control it.

### Eyes of darkness
His night vision allows him to perceive his surroundings even in the darkest of conditions. He can also scare away predators with his glowing eyes which, in the dark, appear ever so slightly menacing.

### Crafty hands
Dexterous hands allow him to handle objects with more ease compared to other dragons. Bluefire is also able to stand and walk on just his two hind feet if he wanted to, at the cost of reduced speed.

### Soaring dragon
Bluefire can use his wings to fly.

### Sharp extravaganza
Bluefire can use his sharp claws to deal out devastating attacks in battle.

### Magic
Bluefire is skilled in both fire and dark magic, the first one more so than the second one. Fire created by fire magic generally exerts the same blue colour as his fire breath.

## Skills
### Alchemy
Bluefire knows some alchemy, which he can use to brew potions that might be useful in certain cases. He needs to prepare these beforehand.

### Technologically adept
Spending time of the overworld with the humans gave him a chance to become familiar with technology. He is able to infiltrate systems and write software.

## Backstory
A long time ago, one of Bluefire's ancestors became a servant of the darkness to protect his beloved ones from them in return for what he did to save the land and the people he held dear to his heart. 

Nowadays, Bluefire's family controls the same land that was back then the dark lord's. By its inhabitants, his family is considered royal. They are beloved, but the continueing shortage is eating away at their reputation. Bluefire was sent to the surface to find a solution.

He blended in amongst all the humans with a human disguise that continuesly appears older at a pace that of the human. He followed human education and bears the advantages of it.
