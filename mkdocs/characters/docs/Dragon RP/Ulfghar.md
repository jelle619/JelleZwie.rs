## Backstory
Ulfghar was a high ranking officer within the Red Union, so high even that he was one of the few within the government that wasn't just aware of the portal, he knew what life really was like on the surface. He knew all the paranoia surrounding it wasn't true. When the collapse happened he was quickly sought by the guerilla fighters that wanted to avenge all Reds. So, he decided to go through the portal unannounced, not knowing what has changed since contact was broken off 30 years ago.
	When he went through he was met by the now abandoned town of Gorodok, having been untouched ever since the USSR collapsed. Ulfghar then decided to walk, for many many miles to come. Luckily Ulfghar was wel constituted and knew how to make it out alive. After passing through many villages he finally found his way to the city of Khabarovsk, where he happened to know a well established contact that knew about the underground due to his rankings in the USSR, called Snaipery. Snaipery helped Ulfghar connect to 'I'.
	Snaipery arranges a meeting between Ulfghar and the organization 'I'. Hereby Ulfghar explains his situation and his desire to save the Red Union, and thus restore order underground. This is in parallel with the mysterious intention of the organization, thus the organization decides to help Ulfghar, albeit in a very precautious manor. That being said, Snaipery is making sure the organization doesn't play any power games over Ulfghar. Eventually they strike a deal where Ulfghar will be body guarded, with Ulfghar now being safe he can now explore the surface and thus device his own plans and with Ulfghar now acting as a bait, since his dead body is very much coveted by those underground, the organization can use him to garner more intellect on fugitives from the underground.
  The body guard assigned to Ulfghar is Broux

## Current situation 
Going around the world, hopelessly avenging anyone opposing his 'iron' fist to horde as much as possible. He tries to hord as much as possible to wait for the (inevitable) revolution to come back around, with the intent to kickstart it with massive wealth.
